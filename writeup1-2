Programing Language: Python3
                     Developed in windows
                     Tested on ubuntu
                     python collections used

Data Structure Used: List of students, where each student is a python dictionary
                     Fields for each student described below:
                     'StLastName': string
                     'StFirstName': string
                     'Grade': int
                     'Classroom': int
                     'Bus': int
                     'GPA': string (could be stored as a float)
                     'TLastName': string
                     'TFirstName' string

                     List of teacher, where each teacher is a python dictionary
                     'TLastName': string
                     'TFirstName': string
                     'Classroom': int

Task Logging:
    Classroom search (2hr)
    Teachers by grade (.5hr)
    Data analytics (2hr)

Testing:
    Combining teacher and student files correctly (1hr)
    Classroom search Test (.5hr)
    Teachers by grade (.25hr)
    Data analytics (1hr)

Additional Comments:
    Program assumes that "list.txt" and "teachers.txt" are formatted correctly
    Each search printout starts with "--{} Results--" where '{}' is the type of search
    If a search returns nothing, "No Results Found" is printed
    I an error is encountered, a printout of what search failed, and the error is printed.
        Is able to continue with additional searches
    Printout if not enough, to many, or invalid arguments are given
    Data analytics only use short format for flags (T/G/B)

    For combining teacher and student sets, program goes through each student, and changes
    TLastName and TFirstName fields based on if the classroom matches a teacher
